h1 About Us
p We make it simple and easy to connect with all things African around you! We realized how hard it can be to find simple businesses, services or products that connect you to your love for Africa. Our platform will help you find, connect, engage, buy, sell, list, create, discover and experience all of Africa around you.

p In our early stage, we will focus on a few cities in the US, but as we grow, we hope to connect every major city in Africa, Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Australia.
